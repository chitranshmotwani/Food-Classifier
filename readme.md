# Food Image Classification Project with MLOps

Welcome to the Food Image Classification project! This repository showcases an end-to-end system for food image classification using TensorFlow, Streamlit, Docker, Kubernetes, cloudbuild, GitHub, and Google Cloud, driven by MLOps principles. The primary objective is to automate the process of building and deploying machine learning models into production using Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) practices.

## Project Objectives

1. **Food Image Classification Model:**
   Build a robust food image classifier utilizing the Food101 dataset from TensorFlow.

2. **MLOps Implementation:**
   - Employ MLOps practices to streamline the entire machine learning lifecycle.
   - Implement data orchestration, version control, and model tracking to ensure traceability and reproducibility.

3. **Technological Stack:**
   - Utilize TensorFlow for building and training the machine learning model.
   - Employ Streamlit to create an interactive web application for users to interact with the model.
   - Implement Docker for containerization to ensure consistent and portable deployments.
   - Utilize Kubernetes for efficient orchestration and scaling of the application.
   - Leverage cloudbuild for automated builds in the cloud environment.
   - Utilize GitHub for version control and collaborative development.
   - Utilize Google Cloud for cloud-based infrastructure and services.

4. **Development Environment:**
   Code development will be facilitated using PyCharm, an integrated development environment (IDE) for Python.
